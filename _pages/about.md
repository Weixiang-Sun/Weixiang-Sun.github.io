Hi! I'm Weixiang Sun, a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of Notre Dame](https://nd.edu/)
, where I am advised by [Yanfang (Fanny) Ye](http://yes-lab.org/) in the [Yes-Lab](http://yes-lab.org/). I received my B.S. in Mathematics from [Northeastern University](https://en.neu.edu.cn/) in 2025. At the end of my freshman year, I was selected for an exchange program with the Department of Mathematics at [NCSU](https://www.ncsu.edu/). During this period, I conducted research in optimization and published my first paper, which sparked my lasting interest in pursuing AI research. I later conducted a research internship at [Lehigh University](https://lehigh.edu) under the supervision of [Lichao Sun](https://lichao-sun.github.io/), with whom I continue to collaborate closely.

My research interests lie in Large Foundation Models and Agentic AI—both in their core aspects (e.g., efficiency, reinforcement learning) and downstream applications in fields such as medicine and finance. Currently, I am focusing on exploring the potential of large language models in psychology, while also investigating the applications of generative models for vision (image, video, and 4D generation).

If you’re interested in my work or would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out at wsun4[at]nd[dot]edu.
